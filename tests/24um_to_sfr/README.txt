(1) get JWST 18um and 21um from the internet
(2) generate a star-forming galaxy with:
    -- constant SFH
    -- solar metallicity
    -- typical dust (Av=1, Avneb=2)
    -- DL07 SED resembling DH02
    -- z=2
(3) measure relationship between SFR and flux by throttling mass up and down
(4) (extra credit) how does this vary with dust attenuation?
